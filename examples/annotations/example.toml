CircumSpect supports annotating traces in a post-processing step, replacing all values that feature an annotation marker.
"""
docs_text = """

The example below demonstrates the disassembler and addr2line annotators.

### Disassembler

The disassembler annotator looks for values marked with a `$da-rv32` or `$da-rv64` marker, 
and attempts to disassemble them as RISCV RV32 or RV64 instruction respectively.

Usage:
```bash
cspect annotate --disasm input.pftrace
```

### addr2line

The addr2line annotator looks for values marked with a `$a2l` marker, and attempts to 
resolve them to a source-file location and function name given the DWARF debug information
in the provided ELF file.

Usage:
```bash
cspect annotate --addr2line ./my_program.elf input.pftrace
```

> [!TIP]
> You can run multiple annotators at once by providing multiple annotator flags. 
> See `cspect annotate --help` for more information
